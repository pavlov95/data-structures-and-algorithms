//33. Search in Rotated Sorted Array

//There is an integer array nums sorted in ascending order (with distinct values).
//Prior to being passed to your function, nums is possibly left rotated at an unknown index k (1 <= k < nums.length)
//such that the resulting array is [nums[k], nums[k+1], ..., nums[n-1], nums[0], nums[1], ..., nums[k-1]] (0-indexed).
//For example, [0,1,2,4,5,6,7] might be left rotated by 3 indices and become [4,5,6,7,0,1,2].

//Given the array nums after the possible rotation and an integer target, return the index of target if it is in nums,
// or -1 if it is not in nums.
//You must write an algorithm with O(log n) runtime complexity.

//Space complexity: O(1)

        //After eliminating half of the those elements the logic applies for the remaining ones
        //This way the time complexity is indeed O(log n)
